# Getting started
```
$ npm install
$ clj -M -m krell.main -co build.edn -c
$ npx react-native start
$ npx react-native run-android
```
# Running the repl
```
$ clj -M -m krell.main -co build.edn -r
```

## Note
Installing node v14.3.0 from nvm seems to have solved the issue `Couldn't find variable: cljs`
